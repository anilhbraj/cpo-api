#  The property file for the CpoFactoryImpl class.

#  The precedence of determining what properties will be used to create an
#  Adapter are Datasource, (Driver, UserUrl, InitialConnections, MaxConnections), 
#  then (Driver, Url, User, Passowrd, InitialConnections, MaxConnections)
#
#  TablePrefix is any prefix that may have been added to the cpo Tables in the database.
#  
#  The following are all the valid properties.   
#
#    tablePrefix - the prefix appended to the default cpo tables
#
#    dbDatasource - The jndi datasource name to be used to make the connection
#
#    Non-datasource properties. Cpo will manage its own connection pool; 
#    dbDriver - The database driver to use
#    dbUserUrl - The database url to use. It must include the username and password.
#    dbUrl - The databasae url to use. 
#    dbUser - The user to log in to
#    dbPassword - The password for the user.
#    dbInitConn - The initial Connections to use.
#    dbMaxConn - The maximum Connections to use. 
#    
#    Optional properties used when the cpo meta data is stored in a different db then the 
#    transaction data.
#
#    metaDatasource - The jndi datasource name to be used to make the connection
#
#    metaDriver - The database driver to use
#    metaUserUrl - The database url to use. It must include the username and password.
#    metaUrl - The databasae url to use. 
#    metaUser - The user to log in to
#    metaPassword - The password for the user.
#    metaInitConn - The initial Connections to use. Cpo only requires one connection for meta data
#    metaMaxConn - The maximum Connections to use. Cpo only requires one connection for meta data
